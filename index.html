            <p id ="intro">Greetings traveller to my game! Here are the rules. You start with various stats that you will see above (soon) as well as enemy stats. You'll roll the 
                dice to be given a stat bonus, making your stats increase! Enemies are unaffected by this. Once the battle starts, you'll have some options, but you only have 3 
                potions to start with, and remember, magic attacks use up MP. <br> When the round is over, you'll get a chance for a bonus before moving onto the next monster, there
                are three monsters in all. Good luck traveller!
