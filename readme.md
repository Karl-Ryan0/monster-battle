### Colour Scheme
![Colour Palette](assets/images/palette.png)

After several trial and error attempts I decided on Aliceblue text and boundaries, set against a Peachpuff background. Buttons will change to purple when hovered to indicate play area.

### Styling
* Buttons are contained within a flexbox to allow scalability.
* All boxes and buttons are rounded and follow the same design.
* Background images change depending on the screen size and orientation.
* Smaller screens have scroll locked to prevent scrolling below the content area.
* Play, content and action button areas will scale depending on screen size and will adapt to bigger screens.
* Above content will also vanish and reappear depending on context.
* Redundant areas and elements will be deleted if not needed anymore.
* Input will check for player name, and use it in the stats area.
* Screens with larger displays will have larger borders to keep the game and action areas relatively high.
